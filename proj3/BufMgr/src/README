**** Project part2: buffer manager ****

Makefile: a sample makefile to compile your project

buf.C: source code for BufMgr class implementation

../include/buf.h: specifications for the class BufMgr

main.C, test_driver.C, BMTester.C: the testing programs

ErrProc.sample: a sample program to help you use the error protocol.

To assist in the creation of the hashmap, we used the c++11 standard 
unordered_map<keyType, valueType, HashFunction>. This means that the 
makefile compilation flags needed "-std=c++11" or "-std=gnu++11". This flag was added to each of the makefile
projects (hfpage, heapfile, and bufmgr)
